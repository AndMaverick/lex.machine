# 🧾 Policy Frameworks

## ⚖️ Purpose

This document maps major AI governance frameworks — **EU AI Act**, **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**, and **GDPR** — to potential automation patterns within `lex.machine`.  
The goal: translate legal requirements into executable code.

---

## 🇪🇺 European Union AI Act

### 🎯 Objective
Create a **risk-based regulatory system** for AI that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and human oversight.

### 🔧 How `lex.machine` Can Enforce It
| Control Area | Automation Concept | Implementation |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Risk Classification** | Tag AI systems by risk tier (unacceptable → minimal) | Metadata schema / Terraform variable |
| **Record-Keeping** | Persist audit logs for each pipeline run | CI/CD artifact retention / Terraform storage bucket |
| **Fairness & Bias Checks** | Quantify outcome disparities | `python/governance/bias_check.py` |
| **Transparency Reporting** | Auto-generate summaries per run | `audit_report.py` *(planned)* |

---

## 🇺🇸 NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

### 🎯 Objective
Provide a **structured lifecycle approach** for managing AI risks across four pillars: *Map → Measure → Manage → Govern.*

### 🔧 How `lex.machine` Can Enforce It
| Function | Automation Concept | Implementation |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Map** | Define system context, data flows, and stakeholders | YAML config + Terraform variables |
| **Measure** | Evaluate bias, accuracy, and robustness | `bias_check.py` + metrics aggregation |
| **Manage** | Continuous monitoring of compliance | GitHub Actions workflow (`bias-audit.yml`) |
| **Govern** | Document and report decisions | JSON + Markdown artifacts |

---

## 🇪🇺 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

### 🎯 Objective
Safeguard individuals’ personal data and ensure AI systems maintain **lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.**

### 🔧 How `lex.machine` Can Enforce It
| Control Area | Automation Concept | Implementation |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Data Minimization** | Validate data source scope | Terraform variable constraints |
| **Right to Explanation** | Generate readable model decision traces | `audit_report.py` *(planned)* |
| **Accountability** | Maintain versioned audit evidence | GitHub Actions artifact uploads |

## 🧠 Core Design Principle

> “Every compliance obligation can be expressed as code.”

`lex.machine` treats governance frameworks as **programmable control systems** — policy-as-infrastructure.

---

## 🗺️ Integration Flow

Policy Text → Control Mapping → Python Validator → CI/CD Enforcement → Audit Artifact

``` 
This document evolves as global regulations do. Each addition strengthens the bridge between **law** and **logic**.
